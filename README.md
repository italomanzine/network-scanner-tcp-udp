# network-scanner-tcp-udp
A network scanner for TCP and UDP sockets, developed to discover the UDP port used by a JWT token receiving service. Compare the behavior of transport protocols and identify open ports. Enhance and customize the code to efficiently detect ports. Contribute to the development of robust scanning solutions.

This repository contains a network scanning program developed as part of an activity to discover which UDP port is being used by the JWT token receiving service. Additionally, the program also performs port scanning using TCP sockets.

The activity aims to analyze and compare the behavior of different transport protocols (TCP and UDP) in detecting used ports. The implemented network scanner allows exploring these functionalities, providing valuable information about open and available ports in the system.

The source code available in this repository provides a solid foundation for understanding and implementing network scanners for both TCP and UDP, allowing for enhancements and customizations as needed. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the identification of ports used by specific services, such as the JWT token receiving service.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this project, collaborating on the development of more robust and efficient port scanning solutions using TCP and UDP protocols.
